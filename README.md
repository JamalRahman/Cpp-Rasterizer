# ClosedGL
A built-from-scratch C++ graphics library and rendering tool.

ClosedGL is designed to transfer theoretical knowledge on vector space mathematics & rendering algorithms into a practical system.
The project uses no libraries except the standard C++ library.

The system comes built with a hand-developed bitmap parsing library, able to read data from .bmp files greater than v3.x (industry standard since Windows NT, breaking from DOS), as well as rendering images to disk as .bmp.
