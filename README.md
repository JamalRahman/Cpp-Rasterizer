# ClosedGL
A built-from-scratch C++ graphics library and cli rendering tool.

ClosedGL is designed to transfer theoretical knowledge on vector space mathematics & rendering algorithms into a practical system.
With that goal in mind, the project uses no libraries except the standard C++ library.

---

The system is able to load an .obj 3D model with an associated .mtl file, render it, and output the render to a .bmp file. All file processing had to be built from scratch, including a small internal bitmap parsing library.

I wrote about the experience developing this project [in my blog](https://blog.jamalrahman.co.uk/graphics-programming-from-scratch/).
