# C++ Rasterizer
A built-from-scratch C++ bitmap library and cli rendering tool.

---

Ths project was an exercise in the linear algebra involved in Graphics engines, and an exercise in C++ development.
As a task to stretch myself, I opted to code everything myself from first-principles, only using the std library.

A requirement to produce images was to write a bitmap library, capable of saving three-colour-pixel data into a file on disk, manually.

The cli rendering tool is able to rasterize a 3D object's wireframe and project it onto the camera's view.
